The Urizen





I fled through the rain to where the starved horses were. Where the black cities and beer set the snakes to twist in the other place. Eyes black and under them too. The windows were dripping. Everything in this place is slightly red. There are mirrors on the wall and tables with stools. It is shit. See she called from beyond with her pale skin and her lips like the berries in the North and that's where the sky thrashes. It thrashes like it's full of black riders riding through the torsion and alkahest, not the blackclouds heaving like Saharan girls in ecstasy but like riders riding from the endless energy of life. Sick. Arabs. Blacks. Any and all of them I could feel the pangs of genocide. I could feel it burning and then I'd close my eyes and images of dreams of visions would climb up my spine and strangle me down to the muck and the burning. See there is a like a poor in me. A poor has been in me for 10 years. You could call it something or call it nothing. You can't call anything what you want to call it. As soon as you name it it goes away. Or you grow it wrongly. Or it becomes what you called it. So. But I'd see her walking down Pender with her black hair and her body like a campfire and I'd spread dark wings in my room and think of her in a kind of oval like rippling pool. And I'd paint her with my finger on my stomach. Near my belly button I'd paint her. I'd drink. I'd drink. I could kill. I could kill. I could smile. I could smile. I could dance. I could dance. See. She. Listless. Temptress. Avelaval. Lavalavalia. Marisalalia. Water dripping on a leaf. A field of human bones. A world. Meetings with rawlegs and innocence at the library. Not near 85 pounds and fresh like morning flowers.

He was out with a friend at a bar on West Pender. It was halloween. There was merriment and costumes all about. And he sat there with a Scottish friend and thought about how it was possible to become such a poor as he was. He told his friend what a poor was. That it was something that had always been here. Something that had been around since existence birthed itself. It was a thing that was cold in the first explosion of that music of energies. Cold and burdened by its own cold and the streams of color from all that other light and matter began to suck themselves away from it and at the same time burned it colder. Until it poised itself in a perpetual emptiness, in a mirrored empty hellscape where not a thing would budge or even eek. Only it could dream, fantasize, it could dream wild dreams against the suns burning on their courses of indifference, and on the nights when its vantage sifted in to the deeps and it could see the scapes of starwork brimming in light, like God had cursed it to watch the great dance unfold from its cruel and dark world, it could see the whole thing falling down, down it's throat to wrestle with the thousand snakes it had created.
He stepped outside for a cigarette and before him was a man in a wheelchair wearing a hospital gown. It was bitter cold outside. The man begged him for help.

I need money for a taxi.
His phone wasn't working.
He went inside and got his friends phone. Through a sea of figures.
We have to get this guy a taxi.
Who?
The poor outside.
Alright.

They called him a taxi and paid the cab driver. Just take him back to the hospital. What the fuck is this guy doing here.
He sat for sometime and drank. Then he went to the bathroom. Then he kicked the toilet and cracked a piece of the top off and then he punched the wall until his hand started bleeding. Then he came out to see the arabs and the faggots drinking and the waitresses feared him and he took three whisky and took three more and tilted his head with his eyes all black and said to the bartender if you knew what is in my head you would never recover.

Then the night sang. On his way home every streetlight sang and doubled and doubled again. And the crones creaked by him with noxious eyes and broken hearts and his boots were untied and he passed a fire on the road and his life was passing by too, passing and passing every second and everything burned. He had a coffee at a small store and sat on a bench. Fat snowflakes fell. She came off the bus looking perfect. She worked and she worked, 6 days a week 10 hour shifts then the busride to work and home another hour and that was it.
You drunk?
Yes. You?
No.
Ok.
There was a city in the sky made of Gold. There was an island hidden in the fog where pale girls bodies smelt like roses. A missile was in his head. Black bones, he said. Black bones and charred hopes, and everything breaking.

Soft I thought about this machine I was certain I could create. A metaphysician, indeed. After getting milk and picking up the laundry and the toilet paper. Yes, seriousness confounds me. Yes, black daggers and strange dreams. I remember a certain affliction from seeking what was in the addicts out there on the street. In their hearts and in their eyes. We leave the haggard and the sick to be burned like puppies. Puppies with broken heads. We pour gasoline on them and set them on fire. We don't want to see them. We want to dance. And I remember how cold the night was that night. When I was drunk and I gave her my whisky and I wanted to have her. The body curled up at the corner of the bed. Her legs crossed and her hands by her side and her hair so thick and full. And my hand pulsing with pain. And the strippers in the dark where we went before. And the thousand addicts clinging to the lampposts before we came inside. The rain on the window. In the apartment building of the dead. Where sirens and knives move along the alleyside. Where the children speak to me: speak, speak back, they'd say. For your life is going away. Everyday, Everyday. Your life is going away. And I'd wear the colored feathers in my room. The feathered headdress for I was alone all nights unless I got a beauty to follow me sometime. So I'd put the feathered headdress on. And I'd birth myself in a mask. I'd lay down on the floor and breathe with my headdress on. And I'd put paint on my face and I'd dance. I'd see black spots in the air. I had a small picture I drew of a face with two spikes on either side and I'd tape it to the wall and put on the feathered headdress on and I'd try to become the face. The creature in the face that I could become. And I'd close my eyes and move all my energy into the top of my skull and I'd breathe and I'd breathe and I breathe the higher air.


Her body as white as the moon. And the bedroom door a little open and that hot slat of light that comes from another room, just lighting so softly across her chest in a pale blue. The almond eyes.

She comes from a different planet. A different world. He is not of any. He is teetering foundationless. She dresses up. Her lips have small cracks on the bottom. And the lips are red.

She sees the nigger boots at the door. She feels the nigger heart sometimes. She can see the truth of the man but does not know the feathered mask is under the bed. The truth? Slaking wolves in the woods. The cold wind cursing the leaves to gnash. The faun helpless. It has tripped. The mother turns then runs. The snow exploding. Intactile silence heave between the pawsteps of the hunters. The faun’s tongue is out. It wails and wails then goes silent. A meteorite threads and burns and dissolves into its final reckoning. The blood streams and falls onto the ground.

On another night he walked down Pender East and she was dressed like a child. Backpack, Pikachu toy dangling, a funny hat. They went under a scaffold of a construction building. The spiderlike shadows crossing them. On the street there was two police cars and a white sheet over something. Someone. She turned to him. He turned to her. But this was a different one. Slimmer, less full, more lovely, less in love. In his room he asked her. She said five years ago when she was twenty-five she had many boys. A Shinjuku boy, a Tokyo boy, an Osaka boy. She'd take the train after work across the mazes of Tokyo and into small apartments where she'd unroll herself and sink her teeth into the shoulders of skinny men that spent thier days coding or sober, alone, drawing ink-flowers. He thought he heard her say it. That word. But she couldn’t have. And his skin was white as bones. They'd go get cheeseburgers sometimes. Then play pool. Belly buttoned waitresses. Canadian girls with all the delirium and colloquial shit falling out there faces. Stussy one, Stussy two. Nigger who? Nigger you. He'd go alone and drink when she was busy. He wouldn't speak. He felt he would throw up if he got to know any of them. Because he could not tell them about the machine behind his eyes that was burning with violence and images, of grand sick objects leaving and entering his head like bats in a funhouse full of mirrors. Like closing your eyes to run with them out there in the forests in the snow, to drink the blood of the kill and snarl against the night and even the rain fears you when it touches your coat, even the stars tremble when you run, and the wind whispers to you and the gentle eyes of prey tremble when they see a shadow that is not you but of your entirety.

You want to go snowboarding?
Yes. I go. She smiles.
Ok.
You go?
No. How are a you waitress and have money to go snowboarding?
I save.
He looked at her.
Yes. And sometimes tips.
I buy too many cheeseburgers.
Yes, she said. Too many cheeseburgers. She smiles again.

Yes. Cheeseburgers. The falling power of her leaving. Then the machine comes in. Works with its fangs and leaks the poison. And intestate creature that seeks to come back for black revenge for the nothing it left and its immortality a debate. Cat dead. Cat alive. Cat dead. Cat alive. Black lead. Summer skies. Heaving breath and I could see through her skin the ribcage like a vision of acid heaven. I could see her lips looked black. I could smell the childish breath. Nato: The smell of garbage. The smell of her skin like lavender. Heal, nigger. Shut your sickness behind a door and bow before the houses of gold. They are building incredible things. Can't you see? World things made for the world. And you nigger? You are dripping down a rusty pipe, speaking to shades when the rain doesn't stop its ceasing. You are like a child of God. Yes. No. Where are you but lost in a world not like your own? Let's call her Zoa. And the other Salema.

They lost their colors like me.

He walked down a small laneway at night. With a small whisky bottle in his hand. He danced in the alley. He danced in the alley. There were bricks that were drinking too. The lamps were drinking too. He could see a spiderweb on a fan sticking out of a building. The spider was big and dark. There were flies in the web. He stood there for a long time and talked to himself about where he was going and what he was going to do. But he still could not remember anything. He could not remember what he was going to do.

She had left and he was alone. And he spent his days working at places he did not want to work at. He spent his time moiling over a vision of a life. Of a machine he could create in his mind that would open up the world. It would crack open the world he was in and he would become in that power and this world would become another one entire. His past steps would be annihilated. Everything he did would be cleared and annihilated. His own movements from then on would come from a whisper of where to go, and where not. What to say. And what not. Every idol would be destroyed as they are all destroyed everyday. Until there are none anymore. He would become the idol of himself and that self would be himself dissolved into others.

And so he worked on his machine. The machine to overcome everything. A machine to become a great visionary and the machines existence filled him with oddities beyond his comprehension. It began to work in him. Through him. As him. It began to show him signs of things. Growths of things. Images of things. Visions of people looking at him with tiny teeth covered in blood. Visions of great works not created and he would shutter at night until she told him ok I can meet you. I can meet you. We can meet at this place.
He sat there with her.
Are you ok tony?
Yes I'm ok.
The dark hair falling around her face.
Are you sure you're ok?
I'm ok. I'm ok. I just thought of something I should do.
What?
Nothing.
Can we drink more alcohol?
Yes.
I love alcohol.
I know. It's good.
She had a lot. And he took her home stumbling to his bed and lay her there and put the blanket over her.
She woke up. Where's my sister? Where's my sister?
You are just sleeping. You don't have a sister.
But where am I?
You're ok. Just sleep.
But I'm going home.
You're not going home.
I don't want to go home.
You're not going home.
I don't like home.

It happened again. And again. He couldn't finalize the machine. He wanted to but he couldn't. It was too difficult to understand. There was a figure in the machine so vastly intense and although it was his machine it seemed to have an intelligence of its own that could not be overcome. He couldn't return and answer to the figure to destroy it. He found the figure somewhere inside of himself and when he let him in he could not get him out. And he could not beat him. And he sat up in bed that night to discourse with vague oval shadows in the corner of his room. She was sleeping beside him. Naked and lovely, he put his hands to her chest. He squeezed her flesh. Then he let go and turned to the thing that was more so then anything.
Is it you? he said 
Who?
You know who.
It might be.
You are real.
I don't know. Who made me.
I did. But others have also?
Have you not seen me dancing? When you feel a rush. Is it not me who is dancing?
And you come from down the stairs.
Yes. I come from down the stairs. 
You are him, himself? 
I am many things. I come from many places. 
Do you regret it? Your act of defiance? 
No. Of course not. How could you regret anything if it shows you who you are.
But sometimes you make me want to weep. Because you believed in something. You believed that you could create another world. Then he took that away from you.


Yes, it said. Yes. In a darker tone. But you should keep trying. It is an admirable machine. And it speaks, of something, it speaks of where truth breaks, and the father becomes lies, and life becomes spirit, and the spirit eats the flesh, and the flesh eats the heart, and the heart eats the truth, and when the heart eats the truth, it keeps beating, but it dies; and the world knows the death, it stamps out the death, for the death is inside everyone, but the world refuses to see it, they try to kill it, and they kill for sport to kill it, they kill it because they hate it, and the nigger is in the alley, raging in the alley, and the fire is in there, and the whip that will come back is in the alley, and the minds that will not sleep until they show the world that it cannot be without Me, they are in the fire and they are in the nigger and they are in the alley, and none can walk without Me, and no soul shall walk without me, not in this world or the next.





He woke her up in the morning. She looked at him oddly. Hey, he said. You're ok. She just lay there sleeping. Are you ok? You want to wake up. 
	No. I don't want to wake up. 
	He got up and stood in is tiny room with his head beating. He went to the tap and drank from it. He cupped the water in his hands and washed his face. 
	Do you want some water? 
	There was no answer. 
	Ok. I'll get you some water. 
	Ok, he heard her say. 
	He sat on the bed and tilted up her head and let her drink slowly. Then she fell dramatically back onto the pillow. Some more water for you.
	He grabbed her head again and tilted her up. 
	About 90 minutes later he woke her up. Hey, sweetheart. Little one. Maybe you want coffee? 
	Yes, he heard, muffled through the sheets. 
	You're ok for me to get you coffee. 
	Mhmm. 
	What if we go get coffee together. 
	She shook her head. 
	Come on. He turned on the light. Let's go get coffee. 


They went outside. China-town in the early morning. They walked down the alleyway and turned right and came into this fancy coffee shop. It was called Matchafriends or something. There was a girl working there and her name was Imogen or something like that. He loved her madly. She had blonde hair and blue eyes and he loved her more than anything in the world. He ordered two coffees and she was there working in the back. He felt like he would die sometimes when he spoke to her. He was 27 years old and he felt like dying because he loved women that he didn't even know. 
	Tony, she said. Tony I want water. 
	Ok. 
	They got the coffee and a glass of water. She drank the water then they walked to the station.
	So I'll see you again. 
	I think so. 
	You want to. 
	Yes. I want to. 
	Ok. 
	I can go. 
	No I'll walk you. It's ok. 
	They walked down Main St. past the American and past some homeless with carts and they past the Subway with Indian boys and the rain started to fall faintly and he wondered just what the world was when he could love someone that he didn't know, and want to love someone he was with, and there could be homeless and sandwich shops and the father of death itself was lingering over everyone like a shadow begging them to discover something they didn't know. And he hugged her. But he was a devil in his heart. He was a devil so he couldn't see her. He couldn't see any girl beacuse he wanted them all. And so he was a devil and this was a lie and his steps were a lie and his machine was a lie too. It was a lie to be alive and a lie to die. But he hugged her. And he thought maybe he could feel something that wasn;t just errant fear of being lost again. So he hugged her as if to love her. 
	Ok. I'll see you again. 
	Ok.
	He called the nigger friend. 
	Hey, nigger. 
	Hey nigger. 
	What're you doing?
	Having some pints. 
	Where?
	North Van. 
	I'm gonna have a panic attack. 
	Yeah. IT's all good. 
	Fuck it. The bar with the faggots and the fancy stuff. 
	Yeah, brownes. 
	Alright. 
	He walked to his truck and opened the door. 
	He screamed. 
	WHole thing smelling like acid. Dead smoke lingering everywhere. A junkie dressed like debutante was in the passenger seat. He kept screaming. She or he kept screaming too. 
	Get the fuck out of here. 
	Sorry, I'm sorry. 
	He watched he/her pick up all her wrappers and bullshit and then leave. 
	He sat in the truck. Thinking about where the cum stain might be. 



He got back to his apartment and ruffled through his drawers. There was about 12 dollars worth of a change. He went outside and went back to the shop and got another coffee. Then he walked up to the park and lay down and closed his eyes. He would speak to himself as if concoting a dissertation with no actual proof or origin or subject. Thing of history, he said That lived. I can't explain the reality of your inexistence. But I cannot believe or unbelieve. When 13 years ago I remember I was a child and a girl-child with eyes darker then the spaces between the stars I had captured in the fumes of an autumn night, and we we went alone behind the bushes in the park, in the lesser light of floodlights of the ice-rink which set the juniper berries to glow in the dark. Her body was not full. Her lips were purple from the cold. Her hair was tied back and two locks fell on each side of her face. In the park friends and enemies exchanged Roman Candles in an onslaught. I pulled her clothing off. Purple, red, blue, slid across her skin. Everything was there. Everything. Nothing else was need in life. And yet. You make us ache and fall. You give the answer but the Other whispers his poision into us. You let him. You let lost dogs starve by roadsides, you let trucklights scare them into the ditches and you let them whimper until no one saves them. You let the mind go into wards, you do not relieve them you let them obssess, you set the time for the sun to implode, you give us moments only to annihilate them then you take the whole thing. 

	He closed his eyes. He breathed. He could find something, somewhere. Out in the ocean where the ferryboats wander and the whales move through the dark.


He met his friend at the pub later in the night. He couldn't park his truck anyhere without a ticket coming. He floated around all of North Vancouver until he gave up. A nigger can't even park anymore, he said, to his friend when he arrived. A nigger can't even park anymore. 

	He ordered a pint. 
	I got booted from here last night. 
	What happened?
	I can't remember. 
	Good. Me either. 
	What?
	Nevermind. 
	Later there were some others that joined them. Roth sat there with his head tilted feeling the booze going up and down his spine. There were some shouts. He opened his eyes. Scottish was telling the girl there something. It was quite clear. 
	First thing was: Shut the fuck up. Second: You're a cunt. 
	The boyfriend of the girl didn't do anything. Scottish was swinging his fists. She told Roth that he should find a new friend. Roth tilted his head and looked at her. What kind of friend? I've met everyone. Just find another like any other? 
	She didn't say anything. They were in there own world. As everyone is. The unlistening are everywhere. She had black hair and she was somewhat pretty. He was just thinking about his car and how many fucking dollar store receipts he created and the little chinese girl at the bank with glasses who asked him again and again, was this for tools or to pay an employee.
	I have no employees. I find tools at garage sales. And I am a liar. 
	Sorry? 
	I am tired.
	You're tired. 
	Yes. So tired. 
	Are you nigger? I can see your bank balance. Are you a nigger?
	Yes. I am. Thank you for asking. My only refuge is listening to the rain. I've worn the same boots for a year. I spend my time working on a machine made of thoughts in a tiny apartment. I curse the heavens and the earth and my dreams religous.
	Back from that imaginistic fog to the simple reality of the bubbles moving up his pint glass. 
	Seen any sukis? 
	No. I'm seeing more hell in drop of water then a war over a million souls. 
	They went outside to smoke. HEll of earth, hell of time, aching for nothing. You are nowhere you ought to be. The slums of the east churn with the same stuff in your heart. Vicious characters, wrath of solitude. Hate for everyone. A brain dissolving from the futureless fog. A tunnel into the heart where no souls walk save you. He got in his truck then crawled into the passenger seat knowing that he could not drive. The Visitor: bitterness with sweetness. He whispered into Roth and showed him memories meshed with fictions, gaptoothed Northen Girls with racoon eyes, a long and black haired temptress from some foggy island, with almond eyes, slender as a shadow, sitting by a fire, there pale skin burning white as the moon. His brain sifted down into them, mucous fell down their thighs, the rayon centres, blood-red lips gushed and trembled in the dark-light of the strange fire, soft river, soft eyes, the flowers on the banks opened to the moon, blackboats on the lake with lantern bearers watched from there cloaked fantasy, and then the adversary took over to rail on of genocidal fantasies, where the brain breaks and the body loses all control and he was gone into it entirely. Roth had dissapeared and it had come in. It had come over to see him. To occupy and say hello. And his right arm started to shake and goosebumps bloomed all over his body. He rolled down the window and puked up bile. He shivered and cursed the earth. He cursed everything and everyone. Latin chatterings in his brain stem. A black ooze betides me, ravens keep my secrets on the telephone wires, then fly their souls into campfires. 
	Yes, it said. You have come to speak again. About the truth. 

	His phone rang. 
	Where the fuck did you go? 
	Huh?
	Where are you? 
	I'm in my truck. 
	Oh. Why?
	I don' know. I had to go. Something was coming to get me. 
	Come back out. 
	Alright. 
	See you soon nigger. 
	Where at the place across the street from the faggots. 
	Yep. 
	Alright give me sometime. 


	This is not good he said. This is not good. With tears falling down his eyes. Whatever this is it is not good. It is not good. I am somewhere. I am somewhere else. I am not here anymore. I am gone.


He stumbled back in the rain to the pub. Blood seemed to be leaking out of peoples eyes. He sat and got a whisky with redbull. He thought about niggerdom. Perpetual niggerdom. Without a light and only a blacker-world coming. And his dreams there were none. This was his dream he just had not seen it. This was the curse he had given himself only to free himself from. But he could not see it. So he drank and the bells shot off from far away. Bells from some horrid place. Some place unknown. Later at night he was back in the squalered regions. Stting againt the bricks and speaking to the frigid and the wasted. A liturgy had commenced and Roth walked by it and looked inside to see the choir singing. And the cross glowing white. And the vagrants and the addicts sitting on the floor. All over 30 years, 40, some 50. They wept as the pastor stood solemn against the wall listening to the choir. He washed around and went into an Irish pub. Some looks from the waitressess. Some hell they don't know of. Some argument they have never heard in there heads. Of dark and light. Stranded. He drank his pint and did not speak. He paid and left to crawl back into his cavern and let the world sleep. 



Permit me my ending. Before it's too late. Then he had fallen again. In the breaks of the light between everything. He called out in the rain, why do you hate me. Why do you hate me? How can you hate me so much? How can you hate me like this. I'm just alone. I am just alone. No answer but the clouds thick hanging, covering the great vastness of everything. A silence like a spider on the wall before it bites. An untemple of earth, posing itself in an alleged existence, and all souls without souls go flowing through a great dream, casted in forms they had no choice being in, and wander you will alone until the end until the bells toll. 


Rain through the night. It kept falling down so strangely in the night. Roth could hear it coming through the window. He got up shaking and made himself a cup of tea and wrapped a blanket over himself. He went out and up the stairs to the communcal showers and put the screaming heat of water on his back. He lay down on the floor and closed his eyes with the water on him. He dried off and he went down the stairs. He put his on work clothes and got in his truck. 

	Fuck, he said. Cunt. Cunt and fuck. 
	He was in traffic. Uptown was quiet nice. If only he wasn't a nigger it would be even nicer. But he was a nigger. He turned into a road. 
	He got to a garage. 
	Hey. 
	Hello. 
	Were going all over hells creation today, said the boss Jud. 
	Nothing like being a nigger with a job. 
	Yeah. 
	He drank about 3 coffees from Tim Hortons just to get some juice from something. He could murder any one of these guys. It would not mean anything to him. They could all fall off a fucking cliff into a scorching fire and burn screaming forever. He got in the van. God dammit. This is it. Isn't it. Then back to the machine to force the world to kneel at my feet. Or, some other monster I could become. Blind slime. Drink tonight. Drink away. No where to go. Nothing to say. The world is stolen. It will be stolen again. It has been sent for you to die. At least it's not Wendy's, he said aloud. 
	At least were not working at fucking Wendy's. 
	The good man laughed. 
	And another thing, said Roth. 
	What?
	At least were not black. 
	The good man smiled. Yeah. That's true. Or fuckin' like women. 
	Yeah at least were not black women with cancer living a hole. 
	Yeah. Not bad. 
	What do you call a one-legged faggot failure with cancer?
	What?
	Terry Fox. 
	What do you call a half-price bentobox?
	What?
	Nagasaki. Full price is called the Hiroshima. How many Jews do you have to kill to make the world better?
	How many?
	All of them. 
	Why did God make black people? 
	Why?
	To remind white people what shit looks like. 
	If you were Jewish, and you wanted to kill a lot of people. What would you do?
	What?
	Make Israel. 
	If you wanted a Jew to suck farts out of your asshole how would you do it?
	How? 
	Tell them if they don't do it, you won't let them bite babies cocks off anymore. 
	Huh?
	I don't know. I was reaching for something. Another coffee nigger?
	Yeah buddy. 
	

Roth finished the day without saying goodbye. He took the bus home. He remembered if he wanted to speak to a woman, if they saw him in his workboots it was a 95% chance they'd say no. So he'd go to the pub. He played pool some nights until late. On the mondays and tuesdays when no one was in the place. He'd sit on the stool and watch the shit on the TV and then play until he could barely see then he'd pay without speaking. He wrote on the back of a piece of paper one night a hellful rendering and he saw when he left that the waitress was reading it. When he came back the next day she went bright red. He said hello and she couldn't speak. So he kept playing. A man came in. He said he came from Afghanistan and was living in the building next door. He said he met an Angel in Edmonton and she drove him to Vancouver and he never saw her again. He said Iblis was an intellectual. A stranger in the world, in his fathers house, and sensitive and cunning. But there was a condition of having everything that remainded sinister. There was nothing to become when your father was God, you could only make a false Kingdom, all that was given to you was the tools of destruction. For all that bumps in the night is a thing trying to usurp the laws of existence. 
	The man had bulging eyes. He looked more like an African. He asked him again. Where are you from? 
	I am from the middle-east. And you are a jew. 
	No. 
	Are you a jew?
	No. 
	Then what are you?
	I'm nothing. 
	You must be something. 
	I'm nothing. 
	Don't pretend. I know you.  
	What the fuck did you just say nigger. Roth stepped up and the man saw the true murder in his eyes. An evil that would follow you home and slit your throat before torturing you. 
	Get the fuck out of here you muslim cunt. I'll gorge out your eyes and listen to you screaming as if it was music. Now go pay the ladies and never come in here again. Roth's right arm was shaking. He seemed to be in a completely different world.
	The man paid quickly and Roth eyes followed him out the door. 
	One of the girls came up to him and when he turned to look at her her head went down and then she walked away akwardly. He almost threw his glass against the wall. He went up to the bar and paid them. They saw his hands trembling. He muttered some bullshit to try to make them not scared. Then he went outside and thought if he could make that man scream, scream and bleed and walk like a starved dog in an empty world, in a desert with no sun, he would set him out there and forver let him freeze and bleed and no death not a death, just an emptiness forever. He would only talk to people like this. He would try to speak to to the others. But it was always just shit coming out. There was no end at the bottom, no end, and the visions in the dark of his room piled on and piled on, and he saw  wolves out in the dark behind his eyes, slinking through the trees, holy wolves invested in the truth alone, hunting for the laggard and the broken, to put them in a place they do not want to go. 


He woke up again for work. Then he heard that you could collect pretty easily and so he thought he just do that. Leech or nigger? He thought. Which is better? Leech or nigger?

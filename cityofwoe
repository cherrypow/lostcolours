The Urizen





I fled through the rain to where the starved horses were. Where the black cities and beer set the snakes to twist in the other place. Eyes black and under them too. The windows were dripping. Everything in this place is slightly red. There are mirrors on the wall and tables with stools. It is shit. See she called from beyond with her pale skin and her lips like the berries in the North and that's where the sky thrashes. It thrashes like it's full of black riders riding through the torsion and alkahest, not the blackclouds heaving like Saharan girls in ecstasy but like riders riding from the endless energy of life. Sick. Arabs. Blacks. Any and all of them I could feel the pangs of genocide. I could feel it burning and then I'd close my eyes and images of dreams of visions would climb up my spine and strangle me down to the muck and the burning. See there is a like a poor in me. A poor has been in me for 10 years. You could call it something or call it nothing. You can't call anything what you want to call it. As soon as you name it it goes away. Or you grow it wrongly. Or it becomes what you called it. So. But I'd see her walking down Pender with her black hair and her body like a campfire and I'd spread dark wings in my room and think of her in a kind of oval like rippling pool. And I'd paint her with my finger on my stomach. Near my belly button I'd paint her. I'd drink. I'd drink. I could kill. I could kill. I could smile. I could smile. I could dance. I could dance. See. She. Listless. Temptress. Avelaval. Lavalavalia. Marisalalia. Water dripping on a leaf. A field of human bones. A world. Meetings with rawlegs and innocence at the library. Not near 85 pounds and fresh like morning flowers.

He was out with a friend at a bar on West Pender. It was halloween. There was merriment and costumes all about. And he sat there with a Scottish friend and thought about how it was possible to become such a poor as he was. He told his friend what a poor was. That it was something that had always been here. Something that had been around since existence birthed itself. It was a thing that was cold in the first explosion of that music of energies. Cold and burdened by its own cold and the streams of color from all that other light and matter began to suck themselves away from it and at the same time burned it colder. Until it poised itself in a perpetual emptiness, in a mirrored empty hellscape where not a thing would budge or even eek. Only it could dream, fantasize, it could dream wild dreams against the suns burning on their courses of indifference, and on the nights when its vantage sifted in to the deeps and it could see the scapes of starwork brimming in light, like God had cursed it to watch the great dance unfold from its cruel and dark world, it could see the whole thing falling down, down it's throat to wrestle with the thousand snakes it had created.
He stepped outside for a cigarette and before him was a man in a wheelchair wearing a hospital gown. It was bitter cold outside. The man begged him for help.

I need money for a taxi.
His phone wasn't working.
He went inside and got his friends phone. Through a sea of figures.
We have to get this guy a taxi.
Who?
The poor outside.
Alright.

They called him a taxi and paid the cab driver. Just take him back to the hospital. What the fuck is this guy doing here.
He sat for sometime and drank. Then he went to the bathroom. Then he kicked the toilet and cracked a piece of the top off and then he punched the wall until his hand started bleeding. Then he came out to see the arabs and the faggots drinking and the waitresses feared him and he took three whisky and took three more and tilted his head with his eyes all black and said to the bartender if you knew what is in my head you would never recover.

Then the night sang. On his way home every streetlight sang and doubled and doubled again. And the crones creaked by him with noxious eyes and broken hearts and his boots were untied and he passed a fire on the road and his life was passing by too, passing and passing every second and everything burned. He had a coffee at a small store and sat on a bench. Fat snowflakes fell. She came off the bus looking perfect. She worked and she worked, 6 days a week 10 hour shifts then the busride to work and home another hour and that was it.
You drunk?
Yes. You?
No.
Ok.
There was a city in the sky made of Gold. There was an island hidden in the fog where pale girls bodies smelt like roses. A missile was in his head. Black bones, he said. Black bones and charred hopes, and everything breaking.

Soft I thought about this machine I was certain I could create. A metaphysician, indeed. After getting milk and picking up the laundry and the toilet paper. Yes, seriousness confounds me. Yes, black daggers and strange dreams. I remember a certain affliction from seeking what was in the addicts out there on the street. In their hearts and in their eyes. We leave the haggard and the sick to be burned like puppies. Puppies with broken heads. We pour gasoline on them and set them on fire. We don't want to see them. We want to dance. And I remember how cold the night was that night. When I was drunk and I gave her my whisky and I wanted to have her. The body curled up at the corner of the bed. Her legs crossed and her hands by her side and her hair so thick and full. And my hand pulsing with pain. And the strippers in the dark where we went before. And the thousand addicts clinging to the lampposts before we came inside. The rain on the window. In the apartment building of the dead. Where sirens and knives move along the alleyside. Where the children speak to me: speak, speak back, they'd say. For your life is going away. Everyday, Everyday. Your life is going away. And I'd wear the colored feathers in my room. The feathered headdress for I was alone all nights unless I got a beauty to follow me sometime. So I'd put the feathered headdress on. And I'd birth myself in a mask. I'd lay down on the floor and breathe with my headdress on. And I'd put paint on my face and I'd dance. I'd see black spots in the air. I had a small picture I drew of a face with two spikes on either side and I'd tape it to the wall and put on the feathered headdress on and I'd try to become the face. The creature in the face that I could become. And I'd close my eyes and move all my energy into the top of my skull and I'd breathe and I'd breathe and I breathe the higher air.


Her body as white as the moon. And the bedroom door a little open and that hot slat of light that comes from another room, just lighting so softly across her chest in a pale blue. The almond eyes.

She comes from a different planet. A different world. He is not of any. He is teetering foundationless. She dresses up. Her lips have small cracks on the bottom. And the lips are red.

She sees the nigger boots at the door. She feels the nigger heart sometimes. She can see the truth of the man but does not know the feathered mask is under the bed. The truth? Slaking wolves in the woods. The cold wind cursing the leaves to gnash. The faun helpless. It has tripped. The mother turns then runs. The snow exploding. Intactile silence heave between the pawsteps of the hunters. The faun’s tongue is out. It wails and wails then goes silent. A meteorite threads and burns and dissolves into its final reckoning. The blood streams and falls onto the ground.

On another night he walked down Pender East and she was dressed like a child. Backpack, Pikachu toy dangling, a funny hat. They went under a scaffold of a construction building. The spiderlike shadows crossing them. On the street there was two police cars and a white sheet over something. Someone. She turned to him. He turned to her. But this was a different one. Slimmer, less full, more lovely, less in love. In his room he asked her. She said five years ago when she was twenty-five she had many boys. A Shinjuku boy, a Tokyo boy, an Osaka boy. She'd take the train after work across the mazes of Tokyo and into small apartments where she'd unroll herself and sink her teeth into the shoulders of skinny men that spent thier days coding or sober, alone, drawing ink-flowers. He thought he heard her say it. That word. But she couldn’t have. And his skin was white as bones. They'd go get cheeseburgers sometimes. Then play pool. Belly buttoned waitresses. Canadian girls with all the delirium and colloquial shit falling out there faces. Stussy one, Stussy two. Nigger who? Nigger you. He'd go alone and drink when she was busy. He wouldn't speak. He felt he would throw up if he got to know any of them. Because he could not tell them about the machine behind his eyes that was burning with violence and images, of grand sick objects leaving and entering his head like bats in a funhouse full of mirrors. Like closing your eyes to run with them out there in the forests in the snow, to drink the blood of the kill and snarl against the night and even the rain fears you when it touches your coat, even the stars tremble when you run, and the wind whispers to you and the gentle eyes of prey tremble when they see a shadow that is not you but of your entirety.

You want to go snowboarding?
Yes. I go. She smiles.
Ok.
You go?
No. How are a you waitress and have money to go snowboarding?
I save.
He looked at her.
Yes. And sometimes tips.
I buy too many cheeseburgers.
Yes, she said. Too many cheeseburgers. She smiles again.

Yes. Cheeseburgers. The falling power of her leaving. Then the machine comes in. Works with its fangs and leaks the poison. And intestate creature that seeks to come back for black revenge for the nothing it left and its immortality a debate. Cat dead. Cat alive. Cat dead. Cat alive. Black lead. Summer skies. Heaving breath and I could see through her skin the ribcage like a vision of acid heaven. I could see her lips looked black. I could smell the childish breath. Nato: The smell of garbage. The smell of her skin like lavender. Heal, nigger. Shut your sickness behind a door and bow before the houses of gold. They are building incredible things. Can't you see? World things made for the world. And you nigger? You are dripping down a rusty pipe, speaking to shades when the rain doesn't stop its ceasing. You are like a child of God. Yes. No. Where are you but lost in a world not like your own? Let's call her Zoa. And the other Salema.

They lost their colors like me.

He walked down a small laneway at night. With a small whisky bottle in his hand. He danced in the alley. He danced in the alley. There were bricks that were drinking too. The lamps were drinking too. He could see a spiderweb on a fan sticking out of a building. The spider was big and dark. There were flies in the web. He stood there for a long time and talked to himself about where he was going and what he was going to do. But he still could not remember anything. He could not remember what he was going to do.

	She had left and he was alone. And he spent his days working at places he did not want to work at. He spent his time moiling over a vision of a life. Of a machine he could create in his mind that would open up the world. It would crack open the world he was in and he would become in that power and this world would become another one entire. His past steps would be annihilated. Everything he did would be cleared and annihilated. His own movements from then on would come from a whisper of where to go, and where not. What to say. And what not. Every idol would be destroyed as they are all destroyed everyday. Until there are none anymore. He would become the idol of himself and that self would be himself dissolved into others.

	And so he worked on his machine. The machine to overcome everything. A machine to become a great visionary and the machines existence filled him with oddities beyond his comprehension. It began to work in him. Through him. As him. It began to show him signs of things. Growths of things. Images of things. Visions of people looking at him with tiny teeth covered in blood. Visions of great works not created and he would shutter at night until she told him ok I can meet you. I can meet you. We can meet at this place.
He sat there with her.
Are you ok tony?
Yes I'm ok.
The dark hair falling around her face.
Are you sure you're ok?
I'm ok. I'm ok. I just thought of something I should do.
What?
Nothing.
Can we drink more alcohol?
Yes.
I love alcohol.
I know. It's good.
She had a lot. And he took her home stumbling to his bed and lay her there and put the blanket over her.
She woke up. Where's my sister? Where's my sister?
You are just sleeping. You don't have a sister.
But where am I?
You're ok. Just sleep.
But I'm going home.
You're not going home.
I don't want to go home.
You're not going home.
I don't like home.

	It happened again. And again. He couldn't finalize the machine. He wanted to but he couldn't. It was too difficult to understand. There was a figure in the machine so vastly intense and although it was his machine it seemed to have an intelligence of its own that could not be overcome. He couldn't return and answer to the figure to destroy it. He found the figure somewhere inside of himself and when he let him in he could not get him out. And he could not beat him. And he sat up in bed that night to discourse with vague oval shadows in the corner of his room. She was sleeping beside him. Naked and lovely, he put his hands to her chest. He squeezed her flesh. Then he let go and turned to the thing that was more so then anything.
Is it you? he said 
Who?
You know who.
It might be.
You are real.
I don't know. Who made me.
I did. But others have also?
Have you not seen me dancing? When you feel a rush. Is it not me who is dancing?
And you come from down the stairs.
Yes. I come from down the stairs. 
You are him, himself? 
I am many things. I come from many places. 
Do you regret it? Your act of defiance? 
No. Of course not. How could you regret anything if it shows you who you are.
But sometimes you make me want to weep. Because you believed in something. You believed that you could create another world. Then he took that away from you.


Yes, it said. Yes. In a darker tone. But you should keep trying. It is an admirable machine. And it speaks, of something, it speaks of where truth becomes lies, and truth is life, so life becomes spirit, and the spirit eats the mind, and the mind eats the heart, and the heart eats the truth, and when the heart eats the truth, it keeps beating, but it dies; and death can not be recovered. No matter how hard you try, when you have killed the heart you don't live anymore, you try, but you're not alive, because you've done something to yourself, and so you will do it to others, and the others will never love you, because you have killed the life that is more than your life. And then you have give yourself to me, and I work through you, and once you let me in, I can never come out. When you knock once, I don't answer. Knock twice, you won't hear me. But when you open the door and tell me to come in. I will never leave. Not in this life or the next. 



He woke her up in the morning. She looked at him oddly. Hey, he said. You're ok. She just lay there sleeping. Are you ok? You want to wake up. 
	No. I don't want to wake up. 
	He got up and stood in is tiny room with his head beating. He went to the tap and drank from it. He cupped the water in his hands and washed his face. 
	Do you want some water? 
	There was no answer. 
	Ok. I'll get you some water. 
	Ok, he heard her say. 
	He sat on the bed and tilted up her head and let her drink slowly. Then she fell dramatically back onto the pillow. Some more water for you.
	He grabbed her head again and tilted her up. 
	About 90 minutes later he woke her up. Hey, sweetheart. Little one. Maybe you want coffee? 
	Yes, he heard, muffled through the sheets. 
	You're ok for me to get you coffee. 
	Mhmm. 
	What if we go get coffee together. 
	She shook her head. 
	Come on. He turned on the light. Let's go get coffee. 


They went outside. China-town in the early morning. They walked down the alleyway and turned right and came into this fancy coffee shop. It was called Matchafriends or something. There was a girl working there and her name was Imogen or something like that. He loved her madly. She had blonde hair and blue eyes and he loved her more than anything in the world. He ordered two coffees and she was there working in the back. He felt like he would die sometimes when he spoke to her. He was 27 years old and he felt like dying because he loved women that he didn't even know. 
	Tony, she said. Tony I want water. 
	Ok. 
	They got the coffee and a glass of water. She drank the water then they went outside, in the autumn sun. Some leaves went across the road.
	So I'll see you again. 
	I think so. 
	You want to. 
	Yes. I want to. 
	Ok. 
	I can go. 
	No I'll walk you. It's ok. 
	They walked down Main St. past the American and past some homeless with carts and they past the Subway with Indian boys and the rain started to fall faintly and he wondered just what the world was when he could love someone that he didn't know, and want to love someone he was with, and there could be homeless and sandwich shops and the father of death itself was lingering over everyone like a shadow begging them to discover something they didn't know. And he hugged her. But he was a devil in his heart. He was a devil so he couldn't see her. He couldn't see any girl beacuse he wanted them all. And so he was a devil and this was a lie and his steps were a lie and his machine was a lie too. It was a lie to be alive and a lie to die. But he hugged her. And he thought maybe he could feel something that wasn;t just errant fear of being lost again. So he hugged her as if to love her. 
	Ok. I'll see you again. 
	Ok.
	He called the nigger friend. 
	Hey, nigger. 
	Hey nigger. 
	What're you doing?
	Having some pints. 
	Where?
	North Van. 
	I'm gonna have a panic attack. 
	Yeah. IT's all good. 
	Fuck it. The bar with the faggots and the fancy stuff. 
	Yeah, brownes. 
	Alright. 
	He walked to his truck and opened the door. 
	He screamed. 
	WHole thing smelling like acid. Dead smoke lingering everywhere. A junkie dressed like debutante was in the passenger seat. He kept screaming. She or he kept screaming too. 
	Get the fuck out of here. 
	Sorry, I'm sorry. 
	He watched he/her pick up all her wrappers and bullshit and then leave. 
	He sat in the truck. Thinking about where the cum stain might be. 



He got back to his apartment and ruffled through his drawers. There was about 12 dollars worth of a change. He went outside and went back to the shop and got another coffee. Then he walked up to the park and lay down and closed his eyes. He would speak to himself as if concoting a dissertation with no actual proof or origin or subject. Thing of history, he said That lived. I can't explain the reality of your inexistence. But I cannot believe or unbelieve. When 13 years ago I remember I was a child and a girl-child with eyes darker then the spaces between the stars I had captured in the fumes of an autumn night, and we we went alone behind the bushes in the park, in the lesser light of floodlights of the ice-rink which set the juniper berries to glow in the dark. Her body was not full. Her lips were purple from the cold. Her hair was tied back and two locks fell on each side of her face. In the park friends and enemies exchanged Roman Candles in an onslaught. I pulled her clothing off. Purple, red, blue, slid across her skin. Everything was there. Everything. Nothing else was need in life. And yet. You make us ache and fall. You give the answer but the Other whispers his poision into us. You let him. You let lost dogs starve by roadsides, you let trucklights scare them into the ditches and you let them whimper until no one saves them. You let the mind go into wards, you do not relieve them you let them obssess, you set the time for the sun to implode, you give us moments only to annihilate them then you take the whole thing. 

	He closed his eyes. He breathed. He could find something, somewhere. Out in the ocean where the ferryboats wander and the whales move through the dark.


He met his friend at the pub later in the night. He couldn't park his truck anyhere without a ticket coming. He floated around all of North Vancouver until he gave up. A nigger can't even park anymore, he said, to his friend when he arrived. A nigger can't even park anymore. 

	He ordered a pint. 
	I got booted from here last night. 
	What happened?
	I can't remember. 
	Good. Me either. 
	
	Later there were some others that joined them. Roth sat there with his head tilted feeling the booze going up and down his spine. There were some shouts. He opened his eyes. Scottish was telling the girl there something. It was quite clear. 
	First thing was: Shut the fuck up. Second: You're a cunt. 
	The boyfriend of the girl didn't do anything. Scottish was swinging his fists. She told Roth that he should find a new friend. Roth tilted his head and looked at her. What kind of friend? I've met everyone. Just find another like any other? 
	She didn't say anything. They were in there own world. As everyone is. The unlistening are everywhere. She had black hair and she was somewhat pretty. He was just thinking about his car and how many fucking dollar store receipts he created and the little chinese girl at the bank with glasses who asked him again and again, was this for tools or to pay an employee.
	I have no employees. I find tools at garage sales. And I am a liar. 
	Sorry? 
	I am tired.
	You're tired. 
	Yes. So tired. 
	Are you nigger? I can see your bank balance. Are you a nigger?
	Yes. I am. Thank you for asking. My only refuge is listening to the rain. I've worn the same boots for a year. I spend my time working on a machine made of thoughts in a tiny apartment. I curse the heavens and the earth and my dreams religous.
	Back from that imaginistic fog to the simple reality of the bubbles moving up his pint glass. 
	Seen any sukis? 
	No. I'm seeing more hell in drop of water then a war over a million souls. 
	They went outside to smoke. HEll of earth, hell of time, aching for nothing. You are nowhere you ought to be. The slums of the east churn with the same stuff in your heart. Vicious characters, wrath of solitude. Hate for everyone. A brain dissolving from the futureless fog. A tunnel into the heart where no souls walk save you. He got in his truck then crawled into the passenger seat knowing that he could not drive. The Visitor: bitterness with sweetness. He whispered into Roth and showed him memories meshed with fictions, gaptoothed Northen Girls with racoon eyes, a long and black haired temptress from some foggy island with almond eyes, slender as a shadow, sitting by a fire, their pale skin burning white as the moon. His brain sifted down into them, mucous fell down their thighs, the rayon centres, blood-red lips gushed and trembled in the dark-light of the strange fire, soft river, soft eyes, the flowers on the banks opened to the moon, blackboats on the lake with lantern bearers watched from there cloaked fantasy, and then the adversary took over to rail into him genocidal fantasies, where the brain breaks and the body loses all control and he was gone into it entirely. Roth had dissapeared and it had come in. It had come over to see him. To occupy and say hello. And his right arm started to shake and goosebumps bloomed all over his body. He rolled down the window and puked up bile. He shivered and cursed the earth. He cursed everything and everyone. Latin chatterings in his brain stem. A black ooze betides me, ravens keep my secrets on the telephone wires, then fly their souls into flames. 
	Yes, it said. You have come to speak again. About the truth. 

	His phone rang. 
	Where the fuck did you go? 
	Huh?
	Where are you? 
	I'm in my truck. 
	Oh. Why?
	I don' know. I had to go. Something was coming to get me. 
	Come back out. 
	Alright. 
	See you soon nigger. 
	Were at the place across the street from the faggots.  
	Alright give me sometime. 


	This is not good he said. This is not good. With tears falling down his eyes. Whatever this is it is not good. It is not good. I am somewhere. I am somewhere else. I am not here anymore. I am gone.


He stumbled back in the rain to the pub. Blood seemed to be leaking out of peoples eyes. He sat and got a whisky with redbull. He thought about niggerdom. Perpetual niggerdom. Without a light and only a blacker-world coming. And his dreams there were none. This was his dream he just had not seen it. This was the curse he had given himself only to free himself from. But he could not see it. So he drank and the bells shot off from far away. Bells from some horrid place. Some place unknown. Later at night he was back in the squalered regions. Stting againt the bricks and speaking to the frigid and the wasted. A liturgy had commenced and Roth walked by it and looked inside to see the choir singing. And the cross glowing white. And the vagrants and the addicts sitting on the floor. All over 30 years, 40, some 50. They wept as the pastor stood solemn against the wall listening to the choir. He washed around and went into an Irish pub. Some looks from the waitressess. Some hell they don't know of. Some argument they have never heard in there heads. Of dark and light. Stranded. He drank his pint and did not speak. He paid and left to crawl back into his cavern and let the world sleep. 



Permit me my ending. Before it's too late. Then he had fallen again. In the breaks of the light between everything. He called out in the rain, why do you hate me. Why do you hate me? How can you hate me so much? How can you hate me like this. I'm just alone. I am just alone. No answer but the clouds thick hanging, covering the great vastness of everything. A silence like a spider on the wall before it bites. An untemple of earth, posing itself in an alleged existence, and all souls without souls go flowing through a great dream, casted in forms they had no choice being in, and wander you will alone until the end until the bells toll. 


Rain through the night. It kept falling down so strangely in the night. Roth could hear it coming through the window. He got up shaking and made himself a cup of tea and wrapped a blanket over himself. He went out and up the stairs to the communcal showers and put the screaming heat of water on his back. He lay down on the floor and closed his eyes with the water on him. He dried off and he went down the stairs. He put his on work clothes and got in his truck. 

	Fuck, he said. Cunt. Cunt and fuck. 
	He was in traffic. Uptown was quiet nice. If only he wasn't a nigger it would be even nicer. But he was a nigger. He turned into a road. 
	He got to a garage. 
	Hey. 
	Hello. 
	Were going all over hells creation today, said the boss Jud. 
	Nothing like being a nigger with a job. 
	Yeah. 
	He drank about 3 coffees from Tim Hortons just to get some juice from something. He could murder any one of these guys. It would not mean anything to him. They could all fall off a fucking cliff into a scorching fire and burn screaming forever. He got in the van. God dammit. This is it. Isn't it. Then back to the machine to force the world to kneel at my feet. Or, some other monster I could become. Blind slime. Drink tonight. Drink away. No where to go. Nothing to say. The world is stolen. It will be stolen again. It has been sent for you to die. At least it's not Wendy's, he said aloud. 
	At least were not working at fucking Wendy's. 
	The good man laughed. 
	And another thing, said Roth. 
	What?
	At least were not black. 
	The good man smiled. Yeah. That's true. Or fuckin' like women. 
	Yeah at least were not black women with cancer living a hole. 
	Yeah. Not bad. 
	What do you call a one-legged faggot failure with cancer?
	What?
	Terry Fox. 
	What do you call a half-price bentobox?
	What?
	Nagasaki. Full price is called the Hiroshima. How many Jews do you have to kill to make the world better?
	How many?
	All of them. 
	Why did God make black people? 
	Why?
	To remind white people what shit looks like. 
	If you were Jewish, and you wanted to kill a lot of people. What would you do?
	What?
	Make Israel. 
	If you wanted a Jew to suck farts out of your asshole how would you do it?
	How? 
	Tell them if they don't do it, you won't let them bite babies cocks off anymore. 
	Huh?
	I don't know. I was reaching for something. Another coffee nigger?
	Yeah buddy. 
	

Roth finished the day without saying goodbye. He took the bus home. He remembered if he wanted to speak to a woman, if they saw him in his workboots it was a 95% chance they'd say no. So he'd go to the pub. He played pool some nights until late. On the mondays and tuesdays when no one was in the place. He'd sit on the stool and watch the shit on the TV and then play until he could barely see then he'd pay without speaking. He wrote on the back of a piece of paper one night a hellful rendering and he saw when he left that the waitress was reading it. When he came back the next day she went bright red. He said hello and she couldn't speak. So he kept playing. A man came in. He said he came from Afghanistan and was living in the building next door. He said he met an Angel in Edmonton and she drove him to Vancouver and he never saw her again. He said Iblis was an intellectual. A stranger in the world, in his fathers house, and sensitive and cunning. But there was a condition of having everything that remainded sinister. There was nothing to become when your father was God, you could only make a false Kingdom, all that was given to you was the tools of destruction. For all that bumps in the night is a thing trying to usurp the laws of existence. 
	The man had bulging eyes. He looked more like an African. He asked him again. Where are you from? 
	I am from the middle-east. And you are a jew. 
	No. 
	Are you a jew?
	No. 
	Then what are you?
	I'm nothing. 
	You must be something. You must be a jew.  
	I'm nothing. 
	Don't pretend. I know you.  
	What the fuck did you just say nigger. Roth stepped up and the man saw the true murder in his eyes. An evil that would follow you home and slit your throat before torturing you. 
	Get the fuck out of here you muslim cunt. I'll gorge out your eyes and listen to you screaming as if it was music. Go pay the tab and never come in here again. Roth's right arm was shaking. He seemed to be in a completely different world.
	The man paid quickly and Roths eyes followed him out the door. 
	One of the girls came up to him and when he turned to look at her her head went down and then she walked away akwardly. He almost threw his glass against the wall. He went up to the bar and paid them. They saw his hands trembling. He muttered some bullshit to try to make them not scared. Then he went outside and thought if he could make that man scream, scream and bleed and walk like a starved dog in an empty world, in a desert with no sun, he would set him out there and forver let him freeze and bleed and no death not a death, only an emptiness forever. He would only talk to people like this. He would try to speak to the others. But it was always just shit coming out. There was no end at the bottom, no end, and the visions in the dark of his room piled on and piled on, and he saw wolves out in the dark behind his eyes, slinking through the trees, holy wolves invested in the truth alone, hunting for the laggard and the broken, to put them in a place they do not want to go. 


He woke up again for work. Then he heard that you could collect pretty easily and so he thought he'd just do that. Leech or nigger? He thought. Which is better? Leech or nigger? He went for another two weeks, a month. Some fucked-out old skateboarder with a broken back and an ego the size of downtown Cleaveland was telling him bullshit. He wanted to crack his skull into the cement and step on his head until the brains fell out. But he was too much of a pussy to do anything like that. He dreamed about other worlds. He dreamed of a small girl working in the coffee shop. Many of them. He dreamed of their small bodies and their pale skin and he dreamed so much he could not stop the dreaming. He dreamed of them calling him. Without fear. He dreamed of them all nights and he dreamed of one that he had but she was not a dream she was real, and that was something he could not understand. That she was real and his life was real. He could not understand this. That flesh could be so nimble. That time could ache and fade. That his coming was on the rise and his ending would annihilate everything. That his memory was true memory. But a great trick it could play, a fiddler was in the house, playing soft lies to withhold his true heart from becoming. 
	







Roth met a pale figure in a bar. Surrounding him was a general air of merriment which gave him a deep dispassion and almost a sickness. There were figures in the back. Like bats in caves inviting him into a different world entire. He walked up behind the pool table and grabbed a cue and sat beside the albino-figure. Whose hands were worn from years of work. Whose eyes bulged out and a scar ran across his bald head. Who the girls with their rawlegs would not come within a 4m radius of. Because of the conditions of his birth. Gentle creature between good and evil, he thought. Can you tell me about the truth of the world? 
	They played together and did not speak. Each stroke of the cue. He was in some ancient breath of a hobgolins shrewd intelligence, it played softly in the walls, softly in the walls the creatures from that other world sank into him through his beer and a pale faggot with painted eyes locked into him from across the room. He looked at him with violence and hate. And he stood as if an exercpt from a latin conjurers notebook, haunting that shadow textured nook of a pub on Main St. The albino spazzed. He looked over. There was rollergirl looking through the window with her tongue-out and her faketits. THe albino was screaming at her like a banshee. Roth never fled such places of conflict. It might've been his greatest art to let the cunts in there stussy watch him with his psychotics in the heat of passions. The backdoor was opened by a barman. The Albino fled without having to be let out. The owner looked at Roth. Decently dressed. Methless eyes. Roth shrugged. He watched the albino and rollergirl move down the road like children in love. 

Later that night his love came to see him. I working so long, she said. I so tired. Glasses. Slim. He liked taking her to places because just at the site of her the bartenders seemed pleased with him, and the waitressess voices went up to a higher octave. Danbo. I go soon. But I do not want to go. 
	It's ok. 
	She looked at him and he still could not feel anything. Because his receiving her and his work on her were all from the world of lies. Deception shows the hidden world. The occupant of the wrong steps is only who it is revealed to. All others will never see it. They sat at the bar. Her hands ran up and down his legs. Up and down. He was always in a state of deviousness. There was nothing in his head that was pure anymore. It was all written in blood. All of it was insanity. Every moment was a gathering of subtle deceptions or a fountain of pain. Even the room could take on an identity. Even the pint-glasses were of a arrogant form, speaking of some rotten thing. Even a garden, even a park, a stone held cunning, a rock was manipulating the truth. The rain was a liar as it nipped his neck. All was against the true host. The creator of the machine. The one who was usurped from the throne. He held his hands on his head, as if to shake it out. 
	What. What's wrong? she said. 
	His hands covering his face. She took them down. His eyes were watering. 
	What is it?
	I can't tell you. 	
	What's going on? 
	Nothing. 
	They walked back down the alley and into his apartment. They lay down in the dark. 
	Can you tell me? she said. 
	No it's ok. 
	Just tell me. The white skin so white in the acid light of the room. Her body slender and lovely. Her hair like a crown of ink as he came over her. 
	What is it? You ok? 
	I am a monster. 
	She smiled. 
	Monstah?
	Yes. But a real one. A real monster. I can't feel anything. I can't feel anything or anyone. It's all gone. It's all lost. 
	But you were crying. 
	No. 
	It's ok. You were crying. 
	I'm a monster. 
	Ok. She smiled. Ok. You are a monstah. 
	One rose had come. There had been no roses for years and he felt one. 
	He smiled. 
	Yes. I am a monster. 
	Come here monstah. Come here. You want to be a monstah. 
	She got up from the bed and grabbed the tiny-baby-glassess he had bought from a dollar store. He kept them in the sock drawer and took them for dirty time. 
	She put them on and moved across the bed. She got to her knees and went right up to the wall. She put her nails on the wall and started scratching the paint. She looked at him. 
	Oh no, she said softly. Help. He a monstah not a man. Help me pwease. I'm dying. I'm dying. He gon kill me. He grabbed her arm and pulled her down. 
	But really. It's really bad. If you came inside my head. You wouldn't recover. You would not come back. 
	It's ok. 
	No. It isn't. 
	Well then fix it. 
	I tried. 
	Then just come to me. She grabbed him. Just come sleep. Just come to bed. 
	
	Nattie was her name. From outside of Tokyo. She worked in a ramen resteraunt on West Pender. On the corner on the opposite side of the street of the Church. He went in there one day. She looked small. And very pretty. He needed to do something unusual so when she came to him Roth said give me two beers. 
	You don't want food?
	No. 
	One beer? 
	No give me two beers. 
	She didn't know what to say. 
	Just put two bottles of beer in front of me please. 
	Ok. 
	When she came back around he said he'd meet her at a coffee shop. 
	

They met in the beautiful summer. He could barely afford anything. He bought her a cappucino and he had one too. Then they walked down to Water St. to look out at the ocean. He couldn't see anything about life. He couldn't see anything at all. He could just see what he wanted and nothing else. And everything was bland and the enemy of his soul. And she was not a reality. Just a thing to play with. And that was what tortured him, but he could not stop it. For he'd seen others like this. And did not yet know they were liars, and sufferers and terrors and hid there weeping and there howls from the social world. And they felt nothing but getting what they wanted, and what they wanted was of no importance. That the world is a house of blind slime ever faking themselves into more non-sense is something he could not understand.

	He kissed her to get her and not to feel her. On the side of the bricks. He kissed her to have her and not for anything else. 
	I rike kissing you, she said. 
	Nigger it said. Deviant nigger your life is one sick story to the next. 

That night she came back to his place. He asked her what it was like. What it was like. She said I don't know what you mean. What it is like when you're gone from it. He came close to her. What does it feel like when your eyes go back into your skull? She said she didn't know. That it was just a feeling. That it didn't really matter. That it was just there then it was gone and it didn't really matter. He remembered her poised in a sauna house on Hastings. Her skin the color of honey in the light of the room. Her small frame as she held her arms around her shins and the ribcage and the bumps of her spine sticking out. He remembered he was having visions that day. More so then other days. The images were like black wings of birds, but almost like curtains, crowding him, like portents of some horrible meeting with something. And he would speak to her but then he would stop. And then he'd do something to make her laugh. And then he'd think if the devil was a color what color would he be. Blue, he said, aloud. Cold and blue and with black-wings of birds flowing through his eyes. 
	What you say? Blue?
	Nothing.
	She looked down at her toes in pink flower socks. 
	The night was cold. He walked her to the Chinatown station. He asked her for Japanese words. She said tick tick was a man walking slowly. Sta-Sta was a busy man on his way to somewhere important. Roth's spine started to shiver. He was so angry he couldn't speak. He got her to the steps as best he could without showing himself. He said goodbye and they kissed. 
	You'll see me again. 
	Yes. 
	He always asked twice. Because he was afraid. 
	Yes I will. 
	And he walked home like a starved soul wanting to cut his skin off, to take his heart out and leave it somewhere under a bridge, where the birds and the dogs would sniff but not eat it. Only the bugs would take it with heartfelt discontent. 

	In the china-town park crews of addicts would spend there night in circles huddling together. They looked like castaway wanderers searching for some religion they could not find. A place that existed on an internal path. So they only moved together, from street to street. And came back to discourse with each other on this place that lived on a perpetual horizon. In the day there were joggers, dog-walkers. Everything was as usual. Only the killer was in his heart and no one elses. The killer with a world that was only his own. He walked along the halls in his head. One night, two nights. A million more. Then dead. In the park a junkies dog got loose from its leash and it ran then it jumped near the centre it was flying and the wind came and the autumn leaves fell with it. 

He saw the nigger one day. A real one drinking by the garbage fire on the side of the road. He went to him. Sit down, young blood. 
	Roth sat on a small bucket.
	I bet your about the dumbest motherfucker on earth. 
	Why's that?
	You like this shit. That's why. You could probably fall into a rich mans pocket just from shaking hands and get some blonde girl that likes shiny things to suck your dick. But you'd rather rail against nothing. And fill up with liqour. 
	Nigger is a nigger does. 
	There he is. Rotten to the core. And no way out. Rotten to the core. 
	And the alternative, said Roth. Zara, some mouth-breather with a pretty face: brain like a tub of shit, condominium, a shiny watch, speak to jews, talk to faggots, discuss the bottle, stomp the weak, ending up killing a jew with a switchblade in the pale moonlight. 
	That doesn't sound so fucking bad. You think that's bad. That's a good life. 
	No. 
	Why? 
	I'd rather just lay in park until things get worse. 
	Shit, man. You ain't stupid. You're a killer. You aren't stupid, no. You're evil or something. Laying in the park isn't laying the park. It's something else. You don't lay down without thinking about a knife and a pussy.  
	Nigger, I got to go. 
	See you blood. Remember. The world was made by the devil. And women were too. 
	I always knew the second part was true. I think I'm starting to understand the first part too. 
	How old are you? 
	Nigger. What does an age matter? What does an age matter to a nigger like you? 
	See you buddy. 
	That was a lean man that lived near the hastings and carrol. Roth thought for some reason that every day was that man's last day. Something in his eyes that said that this was it. And every conversation was like this. The first time Roth met him he looked right into his eyes and Roth said hey nigger. And that was it. They were friends. 



Well he had nothing to do. He left his job and the government was sending him cheques for no reason. Then he'd skeemed a little illegal work. He'd take some off the top of guys that he sent to job sites. So he could work on his machine. And some days he just felt like half a faggot. And he hated talking. He hated looking at people. Somedays he knew he was insane and that made him laugh. Alone. He liked this girl Stella he had made. She had dark hair and could compose strange music but she found her sister one day in Northern Ontario raped and broken in the trees. And across the river there were figures watching. Not men and not wolves but shadow things. Like they came from somewhere else. So she moved with her sister to Vancouver. And her sister was beautiful. And she was too but her eyes were dark and scary. And she sold coke around the town and carried a small pistol in her boots. Some nights he'd go out with a small audio recorder and ask the addicts questions. What happened. Where are you. What was it. Where did it come from. Do you hate it. Do you hate the world, like me. Then he'd listen to his recordings and fit them into his machine with Stella like the centre piece of some monster. And he thought he could make something more real than reality. He thought his machine could be more real than this world. More real than rain and the snow. More real than the blood in his bones. And that was when it came in. And started to speak. And Stella he would create for hours. Her body pale and slender. He would send her down halls with the pistol in her hand and she would see her sister through a window of some cocktail bar with red lips sipping something. And then she would shake, her right arm would start to shake, and her strange melodies became the energies of malevolence and cunning. And she would see her sister on an alter stone with blood streaming down the sides and priests in dark robes ascending a spiral staircase. And haruspices reading the entrails while her sister's lips mouthed strange love to her. Saying from the swells between life and death, I still love you, Stella, even though you have me here, I still love you. And Stella would run through the world. Beneath a bridge in the black liquid air of the night a face like God showed itself to her, surrounded by black tendrils seething, like seams from that Other world showing themselves. Speak to me, she cried. Angels. Speak. And Roth among them, leaning on the bricks, and three of them with their necks tilted speaking into his recorder about the death of the world. And his brain was slipping, and he'd get drunk sometimes to talk to them, because he was afraid of them, and the fear was disguised as hate, because it was easier to hate them then to fear them, because they were like him and everyone else, and he was afraid of something, afraid of the world or the people, or the way the world worked. Everyone seemed to hold a niggers heart behind a mask. Everyone wanted you to know that they were far away from being a nigger. Far, far away. 
	


	Roth was on the bus. He had sold his truck to his friend because he couldn't afford it. Nigger, said the voice in his head. Nigger. He saw Rory sitting there. He watched two Stussy dressed sluts move away as the niggers began to speak about life. They were wearing the same colored boots and the boots had purple ribbons. Rory had a gentetic abnormality and there was a large bump on his head and the girls assumed he had a disease so they got up and moved promptly. And continued to watch tik tok. He smelt there perfume as they passed him. How's life. 
	Shit mate. 
	Yeah. 
	Still doing that parking lot. 
	No, got something a little better. 
	That's alright. 
	You?
	I'm sending guys to job sites. But I have to show up for a couple days so...
	Huh?
	Nothing. I'm the devil, that's all there is to know. 
	Rory smiled. You want to get a pint? 
	Yeah, after work. Maybe. Or I'll just go it alone. 
	Rory said nothing. Roth knew what he meant. 
	Roth scratched his head. 
	I was thinkig about setting this bus on fire actually. 
	Rory smiled. Oh yeah?
	Yeah. Light some faggots hair on fire with axe body spray then bash all the windows yelling allahu akbar. 
	Looks from the passengers. 
	Roth looked around the bus. Make sure there's a little dog that I can fuck in the ass while it's happening. 
	Jesus fuck man. 
	This was Roth's stop. Everyone just screaming. My balls on an old bags face. He got to the busdoor. Open up, he yelled. My cock is hard and that guy right is the reason for it. 
	Rory was no longer smiling. Roth skipped out and did not see that fellah ever again. 
	He got to work. Little cuntface old skateboarder. Roth had genocide in his heart. Violence in his eyes. Let's go, he said. Before I slit this guys throat. 
	He got in the van. All day long he seethed. All day long he hated. 
	
	





See you saw yourself among them. And you thought you could outrun them. And then there were was a final count. And you could kill all things inside of you. And you were workin on your black box in the night, and then she knocked on your door. Hello. 
	Hi. 
	Irish-girl that has just moved in was knocking his door. 
	Do you have any salt or flour?
	Yes. Which one?
	Umm. I don't know. 
	You don't know. 
	Face red. 
	I don't know. 
	Hmm. Well I'll give you salt then. 
	Ok. 
	He handed her the salt. 
	Now. Give it back. 
	Ok. 
	And we'll go to the pub tonight.  
	Ok. 
	Black slick black thoughts streaming up his spine and his wild machine on his desk. The killer. Look what you have become. Killer. Killer in the night. You're heart will swallow you whole. 
	
	
	
















When he got back to his apartment he worked on his machine. He tried to size out and modify this occupant in his head. What were his properties and intentions. He arrogantly supposed that it was more complex then the truth of it. He created figures in and left himself while working to see if the hand that worked would lose itself from his mind and the strings of the puppateer would empty the truth into the machine. He searched for hidden relations, by candlelight. He closed his eyes and breathed and scoured and cursed hmself. He scratched many stones but they would not bleed. He attempted to bridge 6, 7, worlds. He exctracted the the perfumes of memory and allotted them into supposed reasons. He birthed an innocent child then slit her throat. He fought against a shadow in the corner of his room. Sometimes he spoke to it. Sometimes it spoke to him. He'd get up and go out the convenience store in the middle of the night. 
	Hey, the worker said. Number one bullshit guy. 
	Hey. 
	What are you doing?
	Nothing. He tried to have fun with him. But he hated him. He hated him so much. But he was alone and he was afraid of his thoughts and his heart. 





	Roth Davies set out to meet his friend at the pub. Finny, good sir. How are ya?
	Good mate. 
	What's up?
	He fucked my girlfriend. 
	What?
	Yeah.  
	No. 
	Yeah. 
	The liqour kept coming. They were on Granville. Everything was fucked in his head and his friends head was 3x if not more fucked. Strange powders had invited him into there gracious hold. He skunked up in a bathroom. He came out like an angel of energy. He spoke with a delirious articulation. Then 22 minutes later he was incapable of looking anyone in the eye. I think I got to go. 
	Just relax man. 
	No it's so fucked. It's so fucked. I've tried. I've tried to explain. No one is in the land of the spirit. Misery turned to symbols. A black brain and the mother eating the young. The blood is not blood it's something else. 
	Ok ok go home go home. 
	He moved outside. Fuck. Rain. Fuck. Life. Everything spinning. Killer in your heart. Killer in your heart.
